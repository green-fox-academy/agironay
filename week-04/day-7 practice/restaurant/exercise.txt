### Restaurant
Your task is to create a program to model the every day life in a restaurant.
#### Restaurant
- Every restaurant has a `name`, the year it was `founded` and a list of `employees` who are working there.
- It should have a method `guests arrived` which should instruct all employees to `work`
- We should be able to `hire` an employee which will add it to the list of `employees`
#### Employee
- Every employee has a `name`, an `experience` (number) and a method `work`
- The `experience` should start from `0` by default if it is not provided
- Every employee should be able to `work`, however the specific behavior is different for every kind
**We cannot hire or create basic employee** because they should always be some kind of specific employee like `Chef`, `Manager` or `Waiter`.
##### Waiter 
- It should store the amount of `tips` it has - in the beginning this is `0`
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase the amount of `tips` by `1`
  - It should increase its `experience` by `1`
##### Chef
- It should store information about the `meals` it ever cooked (name of the food + amount of times it was cooked)
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase its `experience` by `1`
- It should have a `cook` behavior
  - This should get the `name of the food` as an input
  - This should update the `meals` information so we are able to track that it cooked this specific food again
##### Manager
- It should have a `moodLevel` - in the beginning this is `400`
- Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
  - It should increase the `experience` by `1`
  - It should invoke its `have a meeting` behaviour
- Whenever `have a meeting` is invoked, the `moodLevel` should decrease by the managers `experience`
